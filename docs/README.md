## Who am i?
My name is Jessica Houser. I am 33 years old and I'm almost 34. I'm married and I'm a mother that wants to give the best to my family. I'm a student of Early Child Education. I'm currently working as a teacher in a daycare and I also work as a cashier in a Mexican grocery store. I consider myself highly intellectual and creative. I love to help others when they need it. I love to cook, do pastries and sometimes I become a little crazy when I want something specific. 

I love to learn new things because it keeps my mind busy and fosters personal growth, improves my mental health, and facilitates accomplishing goals, while opening up new opportunities. I enjoy meeting new people from all different backgrounds. I think I am funny and a romantic partner. I love animals and I love doing self-care at home. I've recently started doing yoga which helps me to deal with daily stress and I hope everyone that fings this website enjoys my channel as much as I love doing it. Thanks.
