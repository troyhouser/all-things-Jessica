## Being pregnant?
It is the most amazing thing that ever happened to me. The funny thing is that I always told my parents not to expect babies from me. Well, sometimes destiny surprises you in life and this is one of those times. I remember that everything started when one night I was taking a shower and my breasts felt painful. I was scared and told my husband who started googling. Then he asked about my period. I said, "No way. I'm not pregnant."

I never thought that becoming a mother would be so enjoyable and make me feel so proud of myself, feel happiness, exhaustion, and so much more. I love being a mom even though it requires a lot of energy, time, patience, commitment, and sacrifice. Being a mother is a blessing for me and I'm enjoying it every single day.
